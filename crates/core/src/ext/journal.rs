// SMTP journaling extension point.
//
// Community edition: NoopHandler — journaling is not available and the SMTP
// server behaves exactly as it did before this module existed.
// Pro/Enterprise: an implementation that accepts deliveries from allow-listed
// peers into a dedicated journal account.
//
// **Why an extension point rather than a community feature.** Journaling is a
// compliance capability: it decides what mail is *provably complete*, and it
// must be configured by a compliance administrator, audited, and kept separate
// from the IMAP-synced mailboxes. All of that belongs to the Pro/Enterprise
// layer; the community SMTP server only needs to ask three questions (is this
// peer allowed / is this the journal target / archive these bytes) and must
// keep its old behaviour byte for byte when the answers are "no".
//
// **Why the raw bytes and not a parsed message.** The handler has to be able to
// store exactly what the tenant delivered — the caller's body is the only
// artifact that can support that claim. Parsing happens inside the handler,
// where the format differences between providers (an Exchange journal report
// wraps the original, Gmail's routing rule does not) can be dealt with in one
// place.
